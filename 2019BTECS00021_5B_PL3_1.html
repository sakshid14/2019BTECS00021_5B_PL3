                <h2>What is 5G all about?</h2>
                <p style = "text-align:justify;">In the wireless technology networking world, 5G is the new buzzword. Simply speaking, it is the 5th generation of wireless technology. The 5th generation technology has been envisioned as bigger, faster, better.  5G architecture is built on a much higher next-generation technology plane with the premise to connect everything and everyone – people, buildings, cities, sensors, smartphones, robots, drones. As compared to the existing wireless technology, it will have higher data rates, reduced latency, higher capacity system, energy savings and cost reductions. It will bring new capabilities and create opportunities for society and business. Here is some of the excited chatter about 5G:<br>    
                    “Connected cars will shape the future of individual mobility, and next-generation mobile networks will take car‑to‑x connectivity to a new level.” – Alfons Pfaller, Head of Infotainment Development, AUDI AG<br>
                    <br>
                    “The adoption of 5G will be even faster than what we saw on 4G, which was already fairly fast,” said Ignacio Contreras, Qualcomm’s director of marketing<br>
                    <br>
                    “5G will be the post-smartphone era,” said Robert J. Topol, Intel’s general manager for 5G business and technology. “Phones are the first place to launch because [they’re] such an anchor in our lives from a connectivity standpoint.” <br>
                    <br>
                    “5G is one of those heralds, along with artificial intelligence, of this coming data age,” said Steve Koenig, senior director of market research for the Consumer Technology Association.</p>
              
                <h2>5G in India</h2>    
                <p style = "text-align:justify;">
                    Owing to increased mobile and broadband penetration, India is already in the midst of a digital revolution. But once the future of 5G in India comes to fruition, it will spearhead this revolution and transform the productivity, experiences and aspirations of a billion people in a blink of an eye.<br>

                    Today, “when is 5G coming to India” and ‘is 5G in India already’ are two of the most pertinent questions that all informed citizens have been asking. Although the central government envisaged a viable, robust 5G network in India by 2018, inadequate spectrum availability, exorbitant spectrum pricing, poor development of test cases, deficient back-haul capacity, low reach of optical fibre across the nation and delays in planning have pushed the date to the second half of 2021.<br>

                    Despite all these issues, the number of 5G-connected devices in India is forecasted to be around 350 million by 2026, as per Ericsson. This means that the nation is ready to embrace the next-gen technology soon, with companies involved in 5G in India such as telecom giants like Airtel and Jio ready to commercially roll out 5G by October 2021.<br>

                <h2>Discover the Magic of 3D Computer Graphics</h2>
                <p style = "text-align:justify;">
                    We are in the age of visual computing. Much of what we do on computers – from mobile phones to desktops – involves manipulating and displaying visual information. In fact, human perception is most often determined by visual information. Computer graphics enable us to create three-dimensional virtual worlds and environments that are as realistic as the natural world.<br>
                    <br>
                    Computer Graphics, UC San Diego’s inaugural MOOC, is a thorough introduction to the fundamentals of computer graphics. By the end of the course, learners will be able to write programs that display three-dimensional scenes with accurate lighting. These scenes utilize a variety of modern programming environments, including real-time graphics using industry-standard OpenGL, the GL shading language, and offline ray-tracing.<br>
                    <br>
                    Computer Graphics has become an essential tool in engineering, mathematics and beyond because of its many applications. Computer Graphics is used to build CAD models for cars and, airplanes. It is the backbone of today’s world of blockbuster animation movies. Computer Graphics makes displaying, editing, and sharing on social media easier and more interactive. It allows us to create comprehensive scientific visualizations, using novel camera designs that couple image sensing with computations. Computer-generated imagery and display tools surround us and are a huge part of our everyday lives.<br>
